Below is a section-by-section teardown of hub-itsteddydev.vercel.app and a precise replacement plan so you can reuse the template for your Leggero proposal site without losing a single structural element.
I’ve divided the answer into:
	1.	What the original page contains (verbatim)
	2.	How to rename / repurpose it for Leggero’s proposal
	3.	Suggested copy & content blocks to drop straight in

⸻

1 🔍 Original page inventory (all visible text & nav labels)

UI piece	Native label or text	Source
Language toggle	“en  •  Español”	￼
Hero name line	“Teddy Summers”	￼
Sub-title	“Software Engineer”	￼
Quick-links row	Resume · Portfolio · GitHub · LinkedIn · Instagram	￼
Main nav tabs	Projects · Articles · BooksMarks · Education Hub · Fun Hobbies · Shop Now	￼
Card-grid sample	“Tabler Icons … Skill Icons … SVGL App … Shots … Squoosh …” (resource name + tagline)	￼
Empty-state text	“Oops, no data to display. But don’t worry, there’s always something interesting waiting for you!”	￼

(The template loads the rest of its cards via client-side JS, so the HTML snapshot only shows the labels above.)

2 🔄 Section-by-section replacement plan for Leggero Proposal Hub

Template element	Rename / repurpose	Why / what to show
Language toggle	Keep; swap “Español” for “ES” (future FR/DE slots)	Leggero ships globally; show i18n readiness.
Hero name line	“Leggero Digital Proposal”	Makes purpose unmistakable.
Sub-title	“Comprehensive Web, AI & Ops Modernization Plan”	Instant context; pairs with hero graphic of Dyno/Trak.
Quick-links row	• Executive Summary (PDF) • Full SOW (PDF) • Pricing Sheet (live) • Demo Video Link • Calendly Call	Mirrors original 5-link layout but all proposal-centric.
Projects tab	Products & Deliverables	Each card = Website Pro, AI Chatbot, Command Center, etc.
Articles tab	Implementation Timeline	Cards for Phase 1, Phase 2, Phase 3.
BooksMarks tab	Cost Breakdown	Resource-style cards listing line items and annual options.
Education Hub	Training & Handover	Cards for “AI Chatbot Onboarding,” “Dashboard Workshop,” etc.
Fun Hobbies	Case Studies / Inspiration	Quick demo GIFs (chair configurator, dark-mode swap).
Shop Now	Sign & Pay	Stripe checkout link for deposit; instructions for ACH/Wire.
Resource cards	Replace each icon-tool card with one deliverable card: • “Website Pro – Unlimited pages” • “Dual-Mode AI Chatbot” … (and so on)	Keeps same grid aesthetic.
Empty-state message	“More modules coming—let’s discuss anything you’d like scoped.”	Friendly invitation instead of generic text.

3.3 Card copy examples

(format: Head — Subtext / badge)
	•	Website Pro — Unlimited pages, WCAG 2.2, chair builder
	•	Dual-Mode AI Chatbot — Customer + dealer interface, GPT-4 tuned (includes 2-day training)
	•	AI Blog & Social Engine — Autopost to LinkedIn, Instagram, FB — weekly, brand-safe

Use Tailwind utility classes already in the template (grid-cols-2 md:grid-cols-3, rounded-xl, etc.) so styling stays intact.

5 Dependencies & “missing nothing” checklist
	•	Keep language toggle and theme switching—shows modern stack.
	•	Map every original tab to a concrete proposal need (see table).
	•	Replace all 5 quick-links with proposal artefacts.
	•	Convert every resource card into a deliverable or module card—maintain grid.
	•	Update empty-state copy.
	•	Ensure Shop Now (Sign & Pay) integrates the Stripe deposit.

With these swaps you retain 100 % of the original design’s structure while presenting Leggero a crystal-clear, fully navigable proposal hub that can be shared with stakeholders and signed off—potentially today.
